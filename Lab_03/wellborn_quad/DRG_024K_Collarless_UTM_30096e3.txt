  Description:
    Abstract:
      The Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) is a scanned image of a US Geological
      Survey (USGS) standard series topographic map that includes all collar information
      (e.g., legend, scale bar, index map, etc.) The DRGE is a non-proprietary product
      of a USGS DRG in which the map collar information has been removed.
    Purpose:
      The DRGE is useful as a source or background layer in a GIS, as a means to
      perform quality assurance on other digital products, and as a source for the
      collection and revision of DLG data.  The DRGE can also be merged with other
      digital data, e.g. DEM's or DOQ's, to produce a hybrid digital file. The removal
      of the collar information allows the DRGE to be edge-matched and displayed
      simultaneously in a Geographic Information System.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The DRGE is an 8-bit color image that employs a
      color palette to ensure uniform colors throughout a particular DRG series.
      All DRG's within a series must have the same RGB value.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: N/A
  Completeness_Report:
    According to the USGS, the DRG is a faithfully reproduced
    digital image of the original source map.  Some differences may be detected
    between the source graphic used and the DRG due to the RGB values assigned
    that particular color.  The intent is to recreate those colors as near as
    possible.  Data completeness for DRG files reflect content of the source graphic.
    Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic due to
    scale and legibility constraints.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The datum of the published map is retained to be
        consistent with other USGS digital data.

      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report: N/A
  Lineage:
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: DRG is imported to GRID via imagegrid command.  The appropriate 'clip' coverage is       selected from the master listing of 'clip' coverages based on USGS topo grid system.  The GRID of the DRG is         then re-projected from its UTM zone to geographic, decimal degrees, NAD 27, to form a second GRID.  The             resultant GRID from the projection routine is then 'clipped' using 'gridclip' command against the clip       coverage (as described in Step 2; also DD NAD 27) to create an intermediate working GRID.  'No Data' areas in       the intermediate working GRID are then re-set to the value '13' (13 is the first available number in the color       map for standard USGS DRGs).  To minimize the areas where the value '13' occur, the '.bnd' of the working GRID       was deleted and then replaced by the '.bnd' from the clip cover to produce a final GRID.  The final GRID is          then both exported straight away to TIFF format using the 'gridimage' command in geographic DD NAD83, and       re-projected to UTM NAD83 before also being exported as a TIFF format image in UTM NAD83; also using the       'gridimage' command.
