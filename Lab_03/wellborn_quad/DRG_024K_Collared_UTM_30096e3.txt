-Description-


1.2.1     ABSTRACT:  The Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) is a raster image of a
          scanned USGS topographic map including the collar information,
          georeferenced to the UTM grid.

1.2.2     PURPOSE:  A DRG is useful as a source or background layer in a GIS,
          as a means to perform quality assurance on other digital products,
          and as a source for the collection and revision of DLG data.  DRG's
          can also be merged with other digital data, e.g. DEM's or DOQ's, to
          produce a hybrid digital file.

--Data Quality Information--

-Attribute Accuracy-

2.1  ATTRIBUTE ACCURACY REPORT:  The DRG is an 8-bit color image that employs
     a color palette to ensure uniform colors throughout a particular DRG
     series.  All DRG's within a series must have the same RGB value.

2.2  LOGICAL CONSISTENCY REPORT:  Not Applicable

2.3  COMPLETENESS REPORT:  The DRG is a faithfully reproduced digital image of
     the original source map.  Some differences may be detected between the
     source graphic used and the DRG due to the RGB values assigned that
     particular color.  The intent is to recreate those colors as near as
     possible.  Data completeness for DRG files reflect content of the source
     graphic.  Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source
     graphic due to scale and legibility constraints.  For information on
     collection and inclusion criteria, see U.S. Geological Survey, 1994,

-Process Step-

2.5.2.1   PROCESS DESCRIPTION:  The production procedures, instrumentation,
          hardware, and software used in the collection of standard DRG
          products vary depending on systems used at the contract, cooperator
          or USGS production sites.  The majority of DRG data sets are
          acquired through government contract.  The process step describes,
          in general, the process used in the production of standard DRG data
          sets.

          1. Production of a DRG begins with the scanning of a paper
          7.5-minute topographic map (map1) on a high-resolution scanner.
          Scanning resolutions range from 500 - 1000 dpi with the output file
          running between 160-300 mb.

          2. Removal of screens (descreening) and color quantization to reduce
          the number of colors also takes place during the scanning phase.

          3. The raw scan file is then transformed and georeferenced using UTM
          coordinates of the sixteen 2.5-minute grid ticks, which are obtained
          using the in-house produced program COORDAT and stored in a ground
          control file.  Those sixteen 2.5-minute ticks are interactively
          visited and assigned their respective UTM coordinates. USGS program
          XSHAPES4 then performs a piecewise linear rubber sheet
          transformation.

          4. An output resolution of 2.4 meters (8.2 feet) is chosen in order
          to resample the file to 250 dpi.

          5.  The image file is converted to a TIFF and further reduced by
          converting the file to a run length encoding Packbits
          compression(type 32773).

          6.  The color palette of the compressed DRG is then standardized by
          replacing the original RGB values assigned during the scanning
          process with standard RGB value combinations using the in-house
          produced TIFFREMAP program.

          7.  Prior to archiving the DRG undergoes the following quality
          assurance procedures:

               a. The color index values of each DRG are checked to ensure
               the RGB combinations are consistent with the standardized
               color palette.

               b. All DRG files are inspected to ensure that they are
               geometrically consistent with normal map presentation.

               c. Selected DRG's are checked to ensure that data elements in
               the DRG metadata file correspond to the map collar information
               and to the information in the associated image file.

               d. Selected DRG's are checked for georeferencing accuracy by
               comparing the book value of latitude and longitude tick marks
               with corresponding tick intersections in the DRG image.

               e. Transformations are checked on selected DRG's by comparing
               the positions of well defined points, such as UTM grid
               intersections in the graphic product, with the corresponding
               image points in the DRG.
